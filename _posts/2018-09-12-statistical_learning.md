 In many statistics curriculum students are introduced to the concept of statistical learning.In my masters program 
 a very important book that introduced me to statistial and machine learning models was An Introduction to Statistical
 Learning with Applications in R>> by Gareth James • Daniela Witten • Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani
 This book comes with practical examples of each modelling technique as well as making comparisons among the models .
 See the book here .[An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)  .
