 Very often statisticians and data scientists deal with numerical projects ,however recently there has been an up-surge 
 in the need for individuals who can analyse and process text . Natuaral language processing is becoming a growing area 
 where specialists are in demand. Another alais for this field is Text Mining . I find the Udemy course on 
 Natural Language Processing a very short but comprehensive course for entry level data scientists and enthusiasts .
 Find the details at the udemy website [Udemy Natural Language Processing](https://www.udemy.com/natural-language-processing/).
 You can obtain the course codes from [Intro to NLP](https://github.com/bsacash/Introduction-to-NLP) .
